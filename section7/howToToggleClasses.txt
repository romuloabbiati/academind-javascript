HOW TO TOGGLE CLASSES

- I can use the method .className, but the problem is that I have to 
provide the exact class or all the class names used

- .classList.toggle('cssClassName'); is a better way of adding a class to 
an HTML element, it will toggle the className in and out in the HTML 
element and I don't need to keep track of all class names used in the HTML 
element.
