PRIMITIVE VALUES VS. REFERENCE VALUES

Primitive Values: Strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol
Primitive Values: Stored in memory (normally on Stack). When you copy 
a value from a variable to another variable, it will create a new copy of 
that value. Both variables will point to different places in memory, so if 
I change the value of one of these 2 variables, this change will not 
reflect in the other and so on.

Reference Values: All other objects
Reference Values: Stored in memory (heap) and the variable stores a 
pointer, i.e. an address to the location in memory. If a assign a variable 
to another and change the value of the first variable, it will reflect in 
the latter.
